                    I chose a website for this rhetorical analysis because it appealed to me as a modern way of getting information and it was the format most talked about in class. In retrospect, however, it may not have been the best pick; I quickly ran into problems with the format, the biggest being that I struggled to spatially lay out the content as I wished: while I’d originally wanted arrows referencing specific portions of the propaganda and little blurbs of text for them, I couldn’t figure out in the limited time I had how to accomplish that in a website format without losing the format of a website (ie. of course I could just put those arrows & blurbs of text into an image and just display that image on the website, but then I’d lose much of the website genre in that you wouldn’t be able to highlight text, have links, etc.). In the end I made the most of what I knew how to do and if I had to start over with this assignment, I would use a poster format instead as that would be far easier to create.
